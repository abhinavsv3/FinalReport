\begin{abstract}
Motivated by the problem of understanding data from
the medical domain, we consider algorithms for visually representing 
highly dimensional data so that "similar" entities appear close together. We will study, 
implement and compare several algorithms based on graph and on matrix
representation of the data. The first kind are known as "community detection"
algorithms, the second kind as "clustering" algorithms. The implementations
should be robust, scalable, and provide a visually appealing representation
of the main structures in the data.

\section{Introduction}
\par In this section	we provide an overview of the entire work. We mention the context of the project we have studied, approaches that we have used, goal of the project. We also provide the intended planning, economic estimate and sustainability of the work that has been done.


\subsection{Context Of the Project}
\par In the present day scenario, the modern science of algorithms and graph theory has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex data. Many complex systems are representable in the form of graphs. Graphs have time and again been used to represent real world networks. One of the most pertinent feature of graphs representing real system is community structures or otherwise known as clusters. Community can be defined as the organization of vertices in groups or clusters, with many edges joining the vertices of the same cluster and comparatively fewer vertices joining the vertices in another neighbouring cluster. Such communities form an independent compartment of a graph exhibiting similar role.
Thus, Community detection is the key for understanding the structure of complex graphs, and ultimately educe information from them.
\par

we have complex data today,
    often representable in form of graphs. we need to visualize,
    find structure, etc.

\subsection{Approaches}
Virtually in every scientific field dealing with empirical data, primary approach to get a first impression on the data is by trying to identify groups having "similar" behaviour in data.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Graph Notation}
Graph ,G , is construct consisting of two finite sets, the set V = \{ $v_1,v_2, \ldots ,v_n$ \} of vertices and the set E = \{ $e_1,e_2, \ldots,e_n$  \} of edges where each edge is a pair of vertices from V, for instance,
\begin{center}
$e_i = (v_j,v_k)$
\end{center}
is an edge from $v_j$ to $v_k$ represented as G=(V,E).
